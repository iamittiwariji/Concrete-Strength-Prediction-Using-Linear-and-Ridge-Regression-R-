# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-Using-Linear-and-Ridge-Regression-R-
This project presents a predictive analysis of concrete compressive strength using multiple linear regression and ridge regression in R.   The objective is to understand how concrete mix composition and curing age influence strength, and to compare a baseline regression model with a regularised alternative.
